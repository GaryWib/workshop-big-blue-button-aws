# Cleanup

In order to avoid being charged for the resources we've used in this workshop, you should tear down the CloudFormation stack that we used for the lab.  You can do this in the [CloudFormation console](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) (you may need to change the console region to do this).

If you want to know more about the setup we usedfor this lab, you can go to the [main repo](https://github.com/toshke/big-blue-button-cloudformation-cfhl).
